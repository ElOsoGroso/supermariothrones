TODO:
-Find out why whenever you check highscores or set controls 
before a game it speeds everything up.
-Fix little collision detection stuff.
-Add an effect for the weapon(it's going to be simple)

Where I think we are on points:
-We might not get full points for AI Enemy.
-We deserve points for save game and 2d camera.
-If we don't get points for AI, we make up for it with the save game camera

We wanted to be graded on this:
- Required (63.75 points)
- Animation (7.5 points)
- Sound & Music (7.5 points)
- AI - Enemy (7.5 points)
- Tile rendering (11.25 points)
- 2d Camera (15 points)
- Save Game To Server(15 points)

Total possible: 127.5
